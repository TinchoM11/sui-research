For bridges we can use:
- Wormhole
It's a good option, but it bridges WormholeUSDC. This will make us to make a swap after the bridge is executed

- SWFT
It allows us to bridge USDC or SUI Native token.
The "bad" part is that min. amounts are around 35/40 dollars sometimes.

- STEALTHEX
It bridges to SUI token.
Min. amounts are between 5/15 USD.
The "bad" part is the bridge itself, it's not a blockchain-based bridge.
